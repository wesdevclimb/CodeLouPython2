# Introduction


**_In order to run my project, you'll have to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` The requirements.txt file is located in the root level of this repo which is one level up from this README._**

**_Should the requirements.txt install fail, try and run `pip install pyreadstat` as that is the only dependency used in this project that does not come prepackaged with all anaconda installations._**

**With the notebook file open just click 'Run All Cells and voil√†!'**


Popular belief in American Exceptionalism has had a well documented decline for several years and as the US struggles with the legacy of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic and extremist nationalism, discourse around the United States' international reputation has become very contentious.  

My project will utilize survey data collected by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs to analyze domestic support for the narrative of American Exceptionalism since 2012 and evaluate levels of support accross different demographics. 

Support for American Exceptionalism is quantified in this project by a respondents answer to the question coded as Q21...

Q21: Some people say the United States has a unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world. Others say that every country is unique, and the United States is no greater than other nations. Which view is closer to your own?
1. The greatest country in the world
2. No greater than other nations
3. Refused

Other demographic information is encoded as 'Q1010' = party identity, "weight" = statistical weight, "PPGENDER" = gender, "PPETHM" = ethnicity, and "ppagect4" = age. 

# Hypothesis
I think that the data will show a strong relationship between party identity and support for American Exceptionalism with those identifying as Republicans being much more likely to have support for that political narrative.
