This repo contains both my homework and project files. My project specfic README is down one directory level.

In order to run my project, you'll have to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` The requirements.txt file is located in the root level of this repo. The project notebook itself is located one directory level down in the project folder.

Should the requirements.txt install fail, try and run `pip install pyreadstat` as that is the only dependency used in this project that does not come prepackaged with all anaconda installations.
